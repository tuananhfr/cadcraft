# UbotBuild changes

This branch (`tuananhfr`) is UbotCAD, the UbotBuild build of [CADCraft](https://github.com/storytold/cadcraft) 0.8.0, based on CADCraft by the ArtCraft team, licensed MIT OR Apache-2.0 (see `LICENSE-MIT`, `LICENSE-APACHE`, `NOTICE`). Changes from upstream (Apache-2.0 §4b):

- Removed the ArtCraft logos and marks (`docs/brand/` and its `ATTRIBUTION.md` rows) and every link to the ArtCraft Discord and getartcraft.com, as the ArtCraft brand terms require for modified versions: About dialog, the macOS app-menu Discord item and its `ui.discord` handler, README logo, badges, community and Crafting Apps sections, and the Linux/Windows packaging links (now https://ubotbuild.com/).
- About now reads "UbotCAD — based on CADCraft by the ArtCraft team." and links ubotbuild.com. It stays in English until the bundled UI font covers Vietnamese.
- Dropped the translations of the removed strings from every catalog.
